        <p>Hello! I'm Ash, and this is my graphic design venture. As a graphic designer and artist, the process of reimagining the way we view the world motivates me to create designs that are thought-provoking and provide a fresh perspective for stale minds. I most enjoy creating designs of logos, wordmarks and posters with accompanying illustrations, drawing inspiration from the insightful and vibrant works of artists such as Andy Warhol, H.R. Geiger, Keith Haring and Takashi Murakami - especially their usage of colour and perspective of the subject. I aim to create design that adds function and meaning to a subject that is unique and individualistic - meant for the art and the observer by creating a relation. My approach consists of research and brainstorming, idea formation, drafting and refining to final production - one developing from the other, like clockwork but also ensuring to avoid burnout by creating other forms of art such as music and music.</p>
